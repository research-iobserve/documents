As suggested by the class comment in the RacCreator file, the RacCreator should only be used for testing purposes until the final solution for creating the correspondent model is finished.

1. Since the RacCreator is only temporary class used to create a rac file most of the settings have to be adjusted directly in the class itself:
    - set input and output paths in the main-method
    - set the shortcuts, from the kieker.map file, for BeforeOperationObjectInterfaceEvent, BeforeOperationObjectEvent and AfterOperationObjectEvent in the createCorrespondentMapping-method.

2. The RacCreator uses a palladio repository and a kieker monitoring file to map known functioncalls to existing pcm repository entities. 
   Additionally there is a model mapping file that is used to map call/classes that can not be mapped by name. 
   (On the left side is the class of the call from the monitoring file and on the right the pcm entity that it should be mapped to).
   
3. Next to the mapping.rac, the RacCreator produces two convenience files:
    - unmapped.txt: Contains all entities from the monitoring files that could not be mapped to any pcm repository entity.
    - mapped.txt: Contains all calls(in a convenience format) from the monitoring files that have a direct mapping to a pcm repository entity function.
        - Since the rac contains all functions a correspondent proviedes, even if there is only one function that is mapped to the pcm entity, it is hard to know which calls can actualy be proccesed by iobserve.
